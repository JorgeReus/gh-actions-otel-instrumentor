# gh-actions-otel-instrumentor

This project aims to provide a full github actions tracing with notifications without copy-pasting [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads?actionType=completed#workflow_job)


```bash
.
├── Taskfile.yml                <-- Task Runner
├── src                         <-- Source code for the lambda function
└── template.yaml               <-- SAM template
```

## Requirements

* Propertly configured AWS credentials
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Golang](https://golang.org)
* [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [Go Task](https://github.com/go-task/task)

## Setup process

### Local development

**Invoking function locally through local invoke**

```bash
task sam:local
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should see traces in AWS-xray which show the flow of steps in a github workflow job.

## Packaging and deployment
* To package the application run `task go:build`, this will create a `bin` directory with the binary
* To deploy the lamda function use **TBD** terraform

### Testing

We use `testing` package that is built-in in Golang and you can simply run the following command to run our tests:

```shell
task go:test
```
# Appendix

### Golang installation

Please ensure Go 1.20 (where 'x' is the latest version) is installed as per the instructions on the official golang website: https://golang.org/doc/install
